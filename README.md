# Immaginario Emails

An email parsing desktop application built with Electron and TypeScript. This app allows users to input a list of email addresses in any format, parses them to detect malformed and duplicate entries, and provides options to sort, copy, save, and load email lists.

## Features

- **Free-form Input**: Paste or type email addresses in any format.
- **Parse Emails**: Detects malformed and duplicate email addresses.
- **Sort Emails**: If all emails are valid, sorts them alphabetically, one per line.
- **Copy Emails**: Copies the sorted list to the clipboard (available only when all emails are valid).
- **Save/Load Emails**: Save the email list to a file and load an existing list from the file system.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
npm run dist
